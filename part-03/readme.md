# Please look at Politifact EDA and Preliminary Analysis.ipynb to see how I handled the following tasks:

1. Create a "progress report" that documents:
   - Your approach to exploratory data analysis
   - Your initial results
   - Any roadblocks, setbacks, or surprises

2. Perform initial descriptive and visual analysis of your data.
   - Identify outliers
   - Summarize risks and limitations

3. Discuss your proposed next steps
   - Describe how your EDA will inform your modeling decisions
   - What are three concrete actions you need to take next?
