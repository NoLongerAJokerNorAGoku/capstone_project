(Refer to the data dictionary above for a more detailed explanation of the fields.)\n",

    "The Politifact ruling will be my target variable in this investigation.  There are six different rulings, ranging from 'True' for the most veracious statements to 'Pants on Fire!' for the most egregious lies. Most of the ruling categories have roughly comparable numbers of observations (between 2100 and 2800), except for 'Pants on Fire!', which has 1350.  When the top three rulings are bundled together as 'True' and the bottom three rulings are bundled together as 'False', there are 7600 True statements and 6300 False statements -- so, reasonably balanced.  (This relieves one of my concerns, which was that Politifact would be mostly looking to research statements which seem fishy or controversial to begin with, and that I wouldn't therefore have sufficient 'True' observations to train my model with.  I'm glad that doesn't seem to be the case!)\n",

    "The vast majority of my observations (12300) are Claims, with a further 1600 Attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statement_context variable is tricky, because Politifact seems to have wildly different approaches about how specific this field should be. I've done some work towards generalizing some of the overly-specific contexts, and this is recorded as simple_context in my dataframe.  However, this isn't extremely helpful at the moment, because there are still far too many unique entries.  Generally though, we can see that the statements have been pulled from a wide variety of sources -- speeches, interviews, twitter feeds, campaign materials, debates, articles, and more. Also, note that 114 observations are missing the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statements are from a wide variety of speakers, but we can see that prominent politicians from the last three presidential election cycles (presidential candidates and their vice presidential candidates especially) are particularly well-represented.  Additionally, some of the speakers are not individuals at all, but rather organizations or groups of people like the Republican National Committee or 'Bloggers'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of speakers are either Democrat, Republican, or None. These together account for roughly 13 out of every 14 observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The speaker_job variable has similar problems to the statement_context field.  Many of the observations (around 4000) do not have this information recorded.  Of those that do, the most frequent jobs are those with national political prominence: the president, members of the US House and US Senate, and governors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The subject variable indicates the topic of the statement being assessed, and we can see that there are a wide variety of subjects that Politifact reports on.  The most common topics are the economy and healthcare, which reflects the prominence of these two subjects in the national political debate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dates of these statements range from 2000 through to December 2017. However, there are only two observations from before 2007, since Politifact really started its work during the primaries for the 2008 presidential election."

    "I will evaluate the success of my model on the basis of its accuracy as well as its precision.  (Here, I'm defining a true positive as correctly predicting a lie.)  Precision is important to me in this case because having a high proportion of true 'Lies' out of all predicted 'Lies' would enable journalists for example to use this model to get a good list of leads to follow if they're trying to hold lying politicians to account.  I think it's probably more useful to be pretty confident that the 'Lies' the model identifies are probably lies than to be confident that we've caught all of the lies (because with politicians, that would NEVER be possible anyway, since they lie as easily as they breathe).  If a journalist had to take a lot of time researching statements that ended up being true, it might not be very useful.    \n",

    "- Half-True is actually more true than false, so these statements should be grouped in as broadly 'True'.\n",
